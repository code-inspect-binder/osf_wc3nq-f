betweenness,The proportion of shortest path lengths between all pairs of individuals within the network that include the focal individual (Wey et al. 2008)
outcloseness,Describes how influential a focal individual is within the network. Calculated as the sum of the reciprocal of the shortest path length for initiated interactions between the focal individual and all other individuals (Wasserman and Faust 1994)
